*A classic Minesweeper game built with Java Swing.*

---

## üìå Overview
Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game where the player's goal is to uncover all cells except those containing mines. This project is a Java Swing implementation of the game, featuring:
- Customizable board sizes and mine counts.
- Flagging mechanics to mark suspected mines.
- Recursive cell uncovering for empty areas.
- Win/loss conditions with visual feedback.

---

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### Objective
- Uncover all non-mine cells without triggering any mines.
- Use numbered clues to deduce mine locations.

### Rules
- **Left-click**: Reveal a cell.
  - If the cell is empty, all adjacent empty cells are automatically revealed.
  - If the cell contains a mine, the game ends.
- **Right-click**: Toggle a flag on a cell (to mark suspected mines).
- **Winning**: All non-mine cells are uncovered.
- **Losing**: A mine is uncovered.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Technologies Used
- **Java Swing**: For GUI components (`JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JLabel`).
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Handles mouse clicks and game state updates.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Modular architecture for maintainability.

### Key Classes
| Class          | Responsibility                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Board`        | Manages game state, mine generation, cell uncovering, and rendering.          |
| `MinesAdapter` | Listens for mouse events (clicks, right-clicks) and triggers game actions.    |
| `Minesweeper`  | Sets up the game window (title, icon, layout) and initializes the `Board`.    |
| `Main`         | Entry point to launch the game.                                               |

### Features
- **Safe First Click**: Mines are generated after the first click to ensure the player never loses immediately.
- **Recursive Uncovering**: Empty cells and their neighbors are revealed automatically.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Cells update visually to reflect their state (covered, flagged, revealed).

## üß© Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge               | Solution                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mine Generation Bug     | Implemented a click counter to generate mines only after the first click.|
| Board Dimensions        | Used dynamic formulas to calculate cell positions based on rows/columns.|
| Neighbor-Checking Logic | Applied indirect recursion to reveal all adjacent empty cells.           |


üîÆ Future Enhancements
- **Timer**: Track and display game completion time.

- **High Scores**: Integrate a database to save top scores.

- **UI Improvements**: Modernize the interface with animations and sound effects.

Code Refactoring: Use POJO and design patterns for better scalability.
